## Data Exploration

At this stage, I begin to familiarize myself with the data. I learnt about the data, find what needs cleaning, fill in missing information, check how data is organized, and see if we have the right information to answer important questions.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This involves undertaking the meticulous task of preparing the dataset for analysis, addressing any anomalies or discrepancies revealed during the earlier exploration phase.
- Identified and removed null values from age group and marital status column to avoid inaccuracies.
- Filtered data from preferred cuisine column that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.
- Gathered all relevant data sources, including customer reviews, restaurant information, and demographics data.
- Removed spaces and special characters in age group to make them uniform.
- Ensured the data types are consistent.
- Detect and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

  ## Visualization and Analysis
This is where I begin answering the questions provided. I utilized bar charts to generate insights and visually represent the data.

- The analysis revealed that Tortas Locas Hipocampo received the highest customer ratings, followed by Vips, Unicol's Pizza, Taqieria El Amigo and Tacos Los in descending order.
- It was found that TCX Mex was the most preferred choice among consumers, followed by Turkish, Swiss, Tapas, Tea House and Thai in order of preference.
